## Technical Constraints

### GameCube Hardware Limits

| Resource | Limit | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Main RAM | 24MB | Limits ROM size and buffers |
| ARAM | 16MB | Can store audio or textures |
| CPU | 486 MHz Gekko | Requires optimization |
| GPU | 162 MHz Flipper | Adequate for 2D |
| Storage | SD Card | Slower than disc/cartridge |

### MAME2003 Compatibility

- Focus on pre-1985 arcade games (8-bit era)
- Select 1985-1990 games (16-bit, simpler)
- Avoid complex 3D games
- Avoid games with massive ROM sets

### Development Approach

- **Iterative:** Build in small, testable increments
- **Pragmatic:** Focus on common games first
- **Community-driven:** Listen to user feedback
- **Quality:** Prioritize stability over features
