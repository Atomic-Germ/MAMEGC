# MAME2003 GameCube Port - Development Roadmap

## Project Overview

MAME2003 is an arcade machine emulator that reproduces classic arcade hardware in software. This project ports MAME2003 to the Nintendo GameCube to run original arcade ROM files.

## Current Status: Phase 6 (SD Card ROM Loading) - CRITICAL BLOCKER

The emulator hardware is complete but **cannot run games** because it cannot load ROM files from SD card. This is the current development priority.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- GameCube build environment and Docker integration
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline  
- Basic video initialization and controller input
- Profile-Guided Optimization support

### Phase 2: MAME2003 Core Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- MAME2003 source integrated and compiling for GameCube
- Z80 CPU emulator fully functional
- Memory management system (64KB address space)
- CPU interface layer working

### Phase 3: Video System ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
- Tile-based rendering engine
- Color palette system
- RGB to YUV422 conversion for GameCube display
- 640x480 framebuffer output

### Phase 4: Input System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- GameCube controller integration
- Button mapping for arcade controls  
- Analog stick and multi-controller support

### Phase 5: Audio System ‚ùå ABANDONED
- Sound chip emulation proved extremely complex
- Deferred indefinitely after significant effort

## Technical Constraints

### GameCube Hardware Limits

| Resource | Limit | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Main RAM | 24MB | Limits ROM size and buffers |
| ARAM | 16MB | Can store audio or textures |
| CPU | 486 MHz Gekko | Requires optimization |
| GPU | 162 MHz Flipper | Adequate for 2D |
| Storage | SD Card | Slower than disc/cartridge |

### MAME2003 Compatibility

- Focus on pre-1985 arcade games (8-bit era)
- Select 1985-1990 games (16-bit, simpler)
- Avoid complex 3D games
- Avoid games with massive ROM sets

### Development Approach

- **Iterative:** Build in small, testable increments
- **Pragmatic:** Focus on common games first
- **Community-driven:** Listen to user feedback
- **Quality:** Prioritize stability over features
