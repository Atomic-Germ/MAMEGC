# MAME2003 GameCube Port - Current Status

## What MAME2003 Is
MAME2003 is an arcade machine emulator that reproduces the hardware of classic arcade machines in software. It does NOT contain games - it emulates the original arcade boards (CPUs, sound chips, video hardware) that run the original ROM files.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Hardware Emulation Complete
- **Z80 CPU Core**: Full instruction set emulation, register handling, memory interface
- **Memory System**: 64KB address space with ROM/RAM mapping 
- **Video Hardware**: Tile rendering, palette system, framebuffer output with RGB→YUV conversion
- **Input Interface**: GameCube controller mapped to arcade controls

### ✅ Platform Integration Complete  
- **GameCube Integration**: libogc video output, controller input, memory management
- **Build System**: Docker-based builds, CI/CD, multiple optimization levels
- **MAME2003 Core**: Integrated CPU interface, memory management, driver framework

### 🚨 Critical Missing: ROM File System
**Current Blocker**: No SD card file system implementation
- ROMs exist in `/roms/` directory but cannot be loaded at runtime
- Emulator hardware works but has no game code to execute
- Need libfat integration for SD Gecko/SD2SP2 ROM loading

### 🚨 Missing: Audio Hardware Emulation
**Deferred**: Sound chip emulation not implemented
- Arcade machines used various sound chips (AY-3-8910, etc.)
- Audio hardware emulation is complex and was abandoned after significant effort
- Games will run silent until audio hardware is emulated

### 🚨 Missing: User Interface
**No game selection**: Currently hardcoded driver selection
- Need ROM scanning and game detection
- Need menu system for game selection
- Need settings interface

## Next Critical Steps

### 1. SD Card ROM Loading (Highest Priority)
Without this, the emulator cannot run any games:
- Integrate libfat for SD card access
- Implement ROM file detection and loading
- Add ZIP file support for compressed ROM sets
- Handle ROM validation and error cases

### 2. Game Driver Integration
Once ROM loading works:
- Test with actual Pac-Man ROM set from `/roms/`
- Verify memory mapping matches original arcade hardware
- Debug any timing or compatibility issues

### 3. Basic Menu System
For usability:
- ROM scanning and game list
- Game selection interface
- Basic settings (if needed)

## Current Build Output
- Binary: `mamegc-gc.dol` (~495KB)
- Status: Compiles and runs but cannot load games
- Hardware: Tested on GameCube via homebrew loaders

## Why SD Card Loading Is Critical
MAME emulates arcade hardware that expects to read game code from ROM chips. Without ROM loading:
- The Z80 CPU has no program code to execute
- Video hardware has no graphics data to display  
- The emulator runs but displays nothing meaningful

The ROM files in `/roms/` contain the actual Pac-Man game code, graphics, and data that ran on the original arcade board. The emulator needs to load these files into its emulated memory to run the game.
